    "This is a process that helps to clean the solution. Given that in the process of assembling the solution some sets can be redundant, meaning that several sets can cover elements that are already covered by others, it is useful to run a cleaning process to avoid this situation. This process is called *Redundancy Elimination*. In this case we proceed to check each of the covered sets from higher to lower cost and we decide wether it is good to eliminate it or not.Given that the input files have the cost values for the sets ordered from lower to higher, it is enough to order the covered sets in a descending way to get the higher costs first and try to remove them in this way."

The best ant of the batch is selected and then a *Metropolis Hastings condition* is evaluated to determine whether it is going to be used as the best global solution found or not. This metropolis condition helps increasing the exploration of the algorithm. Given its nature, exploration is increased at the beginning of the algorithm and is less when the algorithm is closer to finish.

    "### Ant Class:\n",
    "Definition of the Ant class. Ant's are the basic unit of an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. In this case the ants contain three main data objects. One to store an instance of the problem. Another one to store the pheromone information and a last one for the heuristic information. In this case a variation of **Max-Min Ant System** is used. There is an important concept for these kind of algorithms known as the pheromone. This idea gives the colony a global communication method, so that ants can share information about their independent process and make the others aware of their findings, contributing to the general global objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this solution the heurstic and pheromone information are defined around the sets, this is a key point that allows the use of an Ant Colony Optimization problem definition for the set covering problem, given that it is not very straightforward to find the conditions that allow using this algorithm for any kind of problem. Here each ant has to select a set to cover in each step giving the idea of a path followed by the ant. The method introduces monte carlo perturbations to set the probability of each set after every iteration over the colony.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind the basic definition of Max-Min Ant System is to define an upper and lower limit for the pheromone values to give the algorithm a higher chance to escape from local minima. In this case the exploration is also enhanced by a simulated annealing process given by the Metropolis Hastings condition. In order to see the main method using the probability based on the uncovered sets and elements we can go to the method *cover_next_set* where the whole step by step covering process takes place. This reflects the proposal of *Ren, Feng et al.*"
