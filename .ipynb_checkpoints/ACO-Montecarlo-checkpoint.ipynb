    "Definition of the Ant class. Ant's are the basic unit of an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. In this case the ants contain three main data objects. One to store an instance of the problem. Another one to store the pheromone information and a last one for the heuristic information. In this case a variation of **Max-Min Ant System** is used. There is an important concept for these kind of algorithms known as the pheromone. This idea gives the colony a global communication method, so that ants can share information about their independent process and make the others aware of their findings, contributing to the general global objective.\n",

Here each ant has to select of a set to cover in each step giving the idea of a path followed by the ant. The method introduces monte carlo perturbations to set the probability of each set after every iteration over the colony.\n",
